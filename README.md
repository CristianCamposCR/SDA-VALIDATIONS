## Description

This is a simple project to validate the use of the Vue 2 framework with Vite. It is a simple form with some validations
using the Vuelidate library for user interface.
Also, the validation of the fields is done in the backend with the hibernate validator.

## üíª Installation

### Backend (Spring Boot)

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CristianCamposCR/SDA-VALIDATIONS.git
```

2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or your preferred IDE.

3. Navigate to the application.properties file located in the src/main/resources directory.

4. Update the database connection configuration according to your local setup.

5. Start the Spring Boot service.

### Frontend (Vue.js)

1. Navigate to the client directory within your project:

``` bash
cd SDA-VALIDATIONS/client
```

2. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

3. Create a .env file at the root of the client directory and add the following environment variable:

```bash
VITE_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```
This environment variable points to the base URL of your Spring Boot API.

4. Start the Vue.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Once the development server is running, you can access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:5173.

6. Try out the fields validation example.


## ‚öíÔ∏èFeatures

### üìï How was the implementation in the frontend?

- The frontend was implemented using vuelidate, where for each field and form,a validation was created.
- In the component has a description of the validations for each field and how to start the validations.
- In the component exists a function named `validations` that contains the validations for each field.
- In the validations was used a helper function, that function needs the message to show the user and the validation to
  do.
  Example:

```javascript
validations()
{
    return {
        form: {
            name: {
                required: helpers.withMessage(
                    "The name is required",
                    required
                ),
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- To show the error message, it was used the vuelidate object `$v` that contains the validation for each field.
  Example:

```html

<div v-if="$v.form.name.$error" class="error">
    {{ $v.form.name.$message }}
</div>
```

### üìì How was the implementation in the backend?

- In the DTO (Data Transfer Object) was used the Hibernate Validator to validate the fields.
- In the DTO was used the annotations to validate the fields. Example:

```java
@NotNull(message = "The name is required", groups = {Create.class})
private String name;
```

- In the controller was used the annotation `@Validate({Class.interface.class})` to validate the fields. Example:

```java
@PostMapping("/")
public ResponseEntity<CustomResponse<?>> save(
        @Validated({Validations.Save.class}) @RequestBody PersonDto personDto) {
  CustomResponse<?> res = this.personService.save(personDto.getPersonEntity());
  return new ResponseEntity<>(res, res.getStatus());
}
```
