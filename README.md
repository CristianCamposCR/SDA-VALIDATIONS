## Description

This is a simple project to validate the use of the Vue 2 framework with Vite. It is a simple form with some validations
using the Vuelidate library for user interface.
Also, the validation of the fields is done in the backend with the hibernate validator.

## ‚öíÔ∏èFeatures

- `General form`: It is a simple form with some validations using the Vuelidate library with diverse fields.

- `Field text`: It is a simple text field with some validations.
- `Field email`: It is a simple email field with some validations.
- `Field password`: It is a simple password field with some validations.
- `Field number`: It is a simple number field with some validations.

### üìï How was the implementation in the frontend?

- The frontend was implemented using vuelidate, where for each field and form,a validation was created.
- In the component has a description of the validations for each field and how to start the validations.
- In the component exists a function named `validations` that contains the validations for each field.
- In the validations was used a helper function, that function needs the message to show the user and the validation to
  do.
  Example:

```javascript
validations()
{
    return {
        form: {
            name: {
                required: helpers.withMessage(
                    "The name is required",
                    required
                ),
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- To show the error message, it was used the vuelidate object `$v` that contains the validation for each field.
  Example:

```html

<div v-if="$v.form.name.$error" class="error">
    {{ $v.form.name.$message }}
</div>
```

### üìì How was the implementation in the backend?

- In the DTO (Data Transfer Object) was used the Hibernate Validator to validate the fields.
- In the DTO was used the annotations to validate the fields. Example:

```javascript
@NotNull(message = "The name is required", groups = {Create.class})
private
String
name;
```

- In the controller was used the annotation `@Validate({Class.interface.class})` to validate the fields. Example:

```javascript
@PostMapping("/")
public
ResponseEntity < CustomResponse < ?
>>
save(
    @Validated({Validations.Save.class}) @RequestBody
PersonDto
personDto
)
{
    CustomResponse < ?
>
    res = this.personService.save(personDto.getPersonEntity());
    return new ResponseEntity < > (res, res.getStatus());
}
```
